# PokemonAPI

Welcome to the Wonderful world of Pokemon!
Are you ready to Battle? 

I've used https://pokemondb.net/type to figure out the super effective stats based on the pokemons you use to battle. While some pokemon have two typings(or even three with Terastilization), I wanted to make it easy based on Gen 1 stats.

I used the following API to get the pokemon information:

Pokemon name list with their stats:
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon/

Pokemon name list with their typing:
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/

Names of the type of pokemon:
https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/type/

The Pokemon Battale starts with you choosing the pokemon you want to use to fight. After selecting the pokemon, press the get "pokemon button" to populate their sprite, typing and their stats.

Once you've seen the information populate, press the "pokemonBattle" button to find out which pokemon has the advantage. 

If you want to know learn more of what I do, click that "Learn a little about me" button at the top to see my Resume.

Cheers!
